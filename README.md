Cheat your way through elementary, middle, high school, and university! Can you cheat all the way to a six figure tech job?!?!

# Status
Current Phase: Prototype Phase
- Getting the extremely basic core mechanics, plan is to expand on the core game

Next Phase: Pre-Alpha (Versioning Guide: Start at v0.1.1 and increment for major additions, like v0.2.0 for new mechanics or level designs)

# # Development Stage Breakdown (Thank you ChatGPT)
# Prototype

Purpose: Test core mechanics, gameplay ideas, or specific systems (e.g., movement, shooting, or collision detection).
Typical Activities:
Experiment with different mechanics to see what’s fun.
Create basic gameplay interactions (e.g., player movement, basic UI).
Test feasibility of ideas without worrying about polish.
Versioning: It’s up to you! Typically, prototypes are rough drafts and aren’t always versioned formally. You could label them like v0.0.1 or just keep them separate as internal builds.

# Pre-Alpha

Purpose: Build on the prototype by adding more features and start forming a cohesive game. The game is not feature-complete yet, but you have enough pieces to see how it’s shaping up.
Start Pre-Alpha: Once you have a prototype or a very basic version of the game that demonstrates the core concept, you move into pre-alpha. This could mean you have your prototype level built and some basic mechanics in place.
Typical Activities:
Add new mechanics and features beyond the prototype.
Start creating basic levels, menus, and UI.
Test and iterate based on feedback and your vision for the game.
Versioning: Start at v0.1.0 and increment for major additions, like v0.2.0 for new mechanics or level designs.

# Alpha

Purpose: The game is now feature-complete. All major systems are in place, but there might still be bugs, placeholder assets, and the need for refinement.
Start Alpha: Once you have all core gameplay mechanics and features implemented, even if they’re not fully polished.
Typical Activities:
Complete all remaining features.
Replace placeholder assets with final ones.
Refine existing mechanics and start fixing bugs.
Versioning: Move to a new major version number, like v0.5.0 or higher, depending on the state of your pre-alpha versions.

# Beta

Purpose: The game is almost ready for release. Focus shifts from adding new features to fixing bugs, improving performance, and polishing existing elements.
Start Beta: Once the game is feature-complete and content-complete, and you’re focusing on balancing, playtesting, and optimization.
Typical Activities:
Fix bugs and optimize the game.
Perform extensive playtesting and gather feedback.
Polish assets, animations, and visual effects.
Versioning: Use labels like v0.9.0-beta or v0.9.0-rc1 (release candidate) for iterations during beta.

# Full Release

Purpose: The game is stable and ready for public release. All planned features and content are in place.
Versioning: v1.0.0 signifies your first official release.
